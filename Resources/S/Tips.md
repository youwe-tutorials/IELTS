# Speaking Tips

- **Note**
  - You do not have to worry about how long each section is as the examiner will manage the time for you. The examiner will move you from one part to the next with such phrases as, ‘Now let’s talk about ...’. He or she can interrupt you if you have spoken long enough on a topic.  


- **Your style of speaking should be:**

  - relaxed
  - natural – *never memorise an answer beforehand*
  - appropriate for an interview.


- **It should also show that:**

  - you are confident
  - you are interested in the topic
  - and that you are enjoying speaking to the examiner.


- **Remember!**

  - Present yourself confidently.
  - Introduce yourself in a relaxed and friendly way.
  - Make a good impression by smiling and being confident.
  - Be aware of your body language – sit up straight and always look at the examiner (eye contact is considered important in Western cultures).
  - Do not tell the examiner that you feel nervous – the examiner already knows this.


-  **Remember!**  

    - Show that you are interested in the questions the examiner asks you.
    - Show that you are willing to communicate. This kind of positive communication leaves a good impression on the examiner.

- **Note**
  - In Part 1 of the Speaking test, the examiner is assessing your ability to communicate accurately and fluently. You should also make sure that your answers are relevant to the question.

  - where appropriate you should give reasons for your answers because this shows that you know how to extend your answer. If you don't give reasons, the examiner will ask you Why? or Why not?

- **Remember!**

  - Answers with two or three sentences are more effective than a simple yes/no.
  - Make sure your answers are relevant to the questions.
  - Don’t be afraid to correct yourself if you make a mistake.
