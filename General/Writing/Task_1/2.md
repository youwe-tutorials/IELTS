The wallet contains some valuable things.**  

In your letter, write to the Station Manager:

-
Write at least 150 words.

You do NOT need to write any addresses.

Begin your letter as follows:

Dear ... ,  

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you as I have left my wallet on a train and would like it to be returned.

The wallet was left on the 5.48 pm train on the City line travelling towards Beachside on Tuesday last week.  I got on at City North and left the train at Downtown. I suspect the wallet fell out of my coat pocket as I was getting off the train.

My wallet is made of black leather with the logo “Armani” embossed on the front.  It contains some important documents such as my driving licence and credit cards, as well as some family photographs that are of great personal value to me, in particular one of my late mother.

I would be grateful if you would make enquiries into the whereabouts of the wallet and keep it for me. I can collect the wallet at the railway lost property office at the Downtown train station.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Andrew Moreton
