Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express the inconvenience that I am facing with the current arrangement of the accommodation on the campus. There are several issues with the present set up which are hindering the progress in my studies.

Firstly, I have been allotted a room on sharing basis with a student who is pursuing a different course in the college. Due to the pandemic, as the classes are being conducted in the online mode, it really becomes difficult for both of us to manage it in the same room. This is because quite often we are supposed to give online presentations or do interaction with the professor. Secondly, the room is not spacious enough to accommodate our belongings and especially the books which we have got issued from the college library.

The semester-end exams are approaching and I am really worried about the present situation. I request you to either allot us a separate room or kindly accommodate us with a student from our respective class. Furthermore, I also request you to provide a locker facility so that we can keep our belongings there safely. Keeping in view the upcoming term-end tests, I hope that the matter will be looked into on a priority basis.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours faithfully,  
Yuvraj Singh
