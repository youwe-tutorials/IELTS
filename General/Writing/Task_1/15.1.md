Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a resident of Ludhiana and I have come to know about your outlet from an advertisement in a local newspaper. I am writing to you to enquire about two electronic items which I require on an urgent basis.

By profession, I am a teacher and due to the pandemic, the teaching-learning process has been shifted to the online mode. I, therefore, require a digital pad along with a stylus for the efficient delivery of my lectures. Besides this, I also require a wireless microphone with an inbuilt feature to filter out the noise.

I would like you to confirm the availability of these gadgets at your showroom or incase of unavailability whether you will be able to order them for me. Also, I will be glad if you could send me the options available along with the price list so that I can make the best choice as per my requirement.

Looking forward to a quick reply!

Yours faithfully,

Y Singh
