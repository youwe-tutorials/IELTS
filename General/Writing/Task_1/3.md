Dear ... ,  

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my disappointment at a delivery error from your online supplier, and to request an immediate exchange of goods.

I ordered an aqua blue coloured dress (reference number 0859368) in size 10. However, the dress that was sent to me was a navy blue colour and a size 16. I spent a great deal of time ensuring the details on my order form were correct before I submitted it.

This situation is frustrating, as I was planning to wear this outfit to an important social occasion next Friday, 17 March, and have bought a pair of shoes and accessories to match. These items do not match the navy blue dress that has been sent.

I would like a replacement to be delivered well before this event. Please ensure that you deliver the correct item to my home address, by courier, within the next 24 hours.

I look forward to your prompt reply and a swift exchange.

Yours faithfully,

Susan Whitworth
