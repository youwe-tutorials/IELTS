**In Britain, when someone gets old they often go to live in a home with other old people where there are nurses to look after them. Sometimes the government has to pay for this care.**

**Who do you think should pay for this care, the government or the family?**

Life post-retirement is often challenging especially in the absence of support from the family or the government. In some countries like Britain, senior citizens often switch to living in old age homes where they are taken care of by the dedicated staff besides an advantage of staying with like-minded age mates. I strongly think that the government sponsoring the care of the elderly in Britain is commendable and is a benchmark for other countries.

In many countries the situation of old aged people is pathetic. Mostly the children often tend to show negligence and ignorance towards their prime duty to take care of their aged parents. Furthermore, many countries not offering sufficient aid for senior citizens further makes the situation worst. This leads to a helpless situation for a person in his or her golden age and thus, in my opinion, the government should make every effort to address this issue.

On one hand, due to the generation gap and rapidly augmenting westernisation, youth nowadays have become self-centred and more ambitious leaving behind their culture and moral duties. Moreover, due to inflation, it has become a challenge even for the young generation to survive and strive for their own livelihood. On the other hand, the government of most countries impose heavy taxes on goods and services. Therefore, it becomes vital for the council to be responsible for the care of its citizens and should pay for their post-retirement care expenses.

In the nutshell, keeping in view the requirements of the elderly and the challenges faced by youth in regard to surviving in this competitive world, it is crucial that the government should allocate funds for the nursing facilities of the golden-agers.
